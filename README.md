            <h3>Projects</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Hearts: I designed and built an “AI” of sorts to play the card game Hearts in Python for a final project in a math lab at UO. Text-based. A key recursive function generates a massive list of all possible tricks, then assigns all cards a value based on safety. The AI simply plays the highest, safest card overall, but always plays an “out” if possible, to avoid taking points.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Work Experience</h3>
            <h4>Pentagon Federal Credit Union</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>As a Member Service Representative (MSR), I provided phone support to credit union members, helping them solve problems, request transfers, apply for loans, and navigate the website in a high-volume, sales-driven environment.</li>
                <li>As both a Loan Processor and Share Processor, I provided internal support to the MSRs via phone and email, as well as processed various financial requests such as cutting checks, MMCD maintenance, processing of student loan refinancing, and loan document processing.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Professional Credit Service</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>As a professional debt collector, I worked at an inbound/outbound call center. I counseled consumers on the options available to resolve a debt. Sometimes this meant that I would request small claims suits and/or garnishments to collect past due funds.</li>
                <li>I used various electronic resources such as TLO, TransUnion credit reports, and various government databases to skip trace for current addresses, phone numbers, places of employment. At one point I was the Team Lead of a section of the Healthcare department before promoting.</li>
            </ul>
